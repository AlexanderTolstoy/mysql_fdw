MySQL FDW for PostgreSQL 9.1+
==============================

This PostgreSQL extension implements a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for
the MySQL.

This code is experimental, and largely intended as a pet project for me
to experiment with and learn about FDWs in PostgreSQL.

By all means use it, but do so entirely at your own risk! You have been
warned!

Building
--------

FIXME: Library requirements etc.

Once that's done, the extension can be built with:

PATH=/usr/local/pgsql91/bin/:$PATH make USE_PGXS=1 make
sudo PATH=/usr/local/pgsql91/bin/:$PATH make USE_PGXS=1 install

(assuming you have PostgreSQL 9.1 in /usr/local/pgsql91).

I've tested on Mac OS X 10.6 only, but other *nix's should also work.
I haven't tested on Windows, but the code should be good on MinGW.

Limitations
-----------
